"""An implementation of the CYK algorithm.

The CYK algorithm was chosen because the Google
docstring format allows for ambiguous representations,
which CYK can handle without devolving into a terrible
complexity. (It has a worst case of O(n^3).

There are faster, on average, algorithms, which might
be better suited to the average task of Darglint2.
However, CYK is relatively simple, and is well documented.
(Others, like chart parsing, are much more difficult
to find examples of.)

This representation was based directly on the wikipedia
article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm.
